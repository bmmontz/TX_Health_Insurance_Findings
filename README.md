# TX-Health-Insurance-Findings
Using Pivot Tables and Charts on an Excel Spreadsheet, I will display my findings on selected characteristics of helath insurance coverage in the United States. 

The data for this project was provided by the United States Sensus Bureau.

## Age

When looking at the chart above it is clear that the population age range that is most insured is the 19 to 64 years age range, but that is also the widest age range in comparison to the others. The second highest group that is most insured is Under 19 years which tells me that they are minors insured by their parents. Because there are three ranges that include minors I added a slicer in order to filter and analyze the data better. 
Once minors have been filtred from the chart the highest insured age range is 65 years and older- according to Yahoo!FInance, the average retirement age in the state of Texas is 65. 
Once the ranges from 65 and above, the age range of Texans 35 to 44 years are more likely to be insured while Texans 26 to 34 are more likely to be uninsured. 

## Sex

In the table above I found that women are more likely to be insured than men. 

## Race & Origin

When looking at which race or origin is most likely to be insured, I found that White alone, White alone not Hispanic or Latino, and Hispanic or Latino (of any race) are the top three but they are the highest race and origins to be uninsured in the state of Texas.
