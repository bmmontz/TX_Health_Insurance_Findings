# Texas Health Insurance Findings
I have displayed my findings on selected characteristics of health insurance coverage in the state of Texas using pivot tables, charts and slicers on an Excel spreadsheet. 

The [data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Texas%20Health&tid=ACSST1Y2021.S2701) for this project was provided by the United States Census Bureau. There were a total of eleven different characteristics accounted for, however I focused on five: Age, Sex, Race & Origin, Educational Attainment and Employment Status. 


## Age

When looking at the chart above it is clear that the population age range that is most insured is the 19 to 64 years age range, but that is also the widest age range in comparison to the others. The second highest group that is most insured is Under 19 years which tells me that they are minors likely to be insured by their parents. Because there are three ranges that include minors I added a slicer in order to filter and analyze the data better. 
Once minors have been filtred from the chart the highest insured age range is 65 years and older- according to *Yahoo!Finance*, [the average retirement age in the state of Texas is 65](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/average-retirement-age-every-state-150000450.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGa8NaNcMFxtjPtEjQMg0RPsYUeF0etFYu3oBFqZMGIvkbXK90og1yS_AZldMRpj3DmW_XLGuD-LvHD_Yyo6Tnm-YlFgr8hD_5UovySagk7cuw1VT8esDisK94aPesrGZxG3CjJH_BpOLADhnHrKmVQ4w5nKaAI3tgvWFqbAA4pr). 
Once the ranges from 65 and above, the age range of Texans 35 to 44 years are more likely to be insured while Texans 26 to 34 are more likely to be uninsured. 

## Sex

In the table above I found that women are more likely to be insured than men. 

## Race & Origin

When looking at which race or origin is most likely to be insured, I found that White alone, White alone not Hispanic or Latino, and Hispanic or Latino (of any race) are the top three but they are also the highest race and origins to be uninsured in the state of Texas. 

## Educational Attainment

It is estimated that more Texans with a Bachelor's degree or higher are insured and the least uninsured.

## Employment Status

Texans that are employed or in the labor force are more likely to be insured than those that are unemployed or not in the labor force. 
*Chron.* reported that [the labor force is a blanket term describing an entire collection of people either employed or seeking employment](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/differences-between-labor-force-employees-36901.html).

## Conclusion

The data provided by the U.S Census Bureau presented the different characteristics possessed by the insured and uninsured Texan populous.

The following are the highest insured groups based on the five characteristics that I chose to focus on.  
* Age: 35 to 44 years
* Sex: Women
* Race & Origin: White alone
* Educational Attainment: Bachelor's degree or higher
* Employment Status: In labor force

The data provided was general and I would have liked to analyze the groups further and more detailed. For example, which gender was the most insured in the age group 35 to 44 years and of those, what was their race & origin and educational attainment and so on.
